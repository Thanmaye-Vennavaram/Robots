        <p style="border: 1px dashed #B0C4DE; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px;"> Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics, electronics, bioengineering, computer engineering, control engineering, software engineering, mathematics, etc. 
<br> <br>
Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. <img src="https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/robotics-pillar-page-overview.jpeg" width="110px" style="float: left; padding: 20px;">
<br> <br>
Certain robots require user input to operate while other robots function autonomously. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. </p> </section>

     <article id="history">
       <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;"> Origins of "robot" and "robotics" </h2> <img src="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/robotics/r2d2.jpg" width="250px" style="float: right; margin: 20px;">
       <p class="hp"> The word "robot" conjures up a variety of images, from R2D2 and C3PO of Star Wars fame; to human-like machines that exist to serve their creators (perhaps in the form of the cooking and cleaning Rosie in the popular cartoon series the Jetsons); to the Rover Sojourner, which explored the Martian landscape as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission.  Some people may alternatively perceive robots as dangerous technological ventures that will someday lead to the demise of the human race, either by outsmarting or outmuscling us and taking over the world, or by turning us into completely technology-dependent beings who passively sit by and program robots to do all of our work.  In fact, the first use of the word "robot" occurred in a play about mechanical men that are built to work on factory assembly lines and that rebel against their human masters.  These machines in R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), written by Czech playwright Karl Capek in 1921, got their name from the Czech word for slave. 
       <br> <br> 
       The word "robotics" was also coined by a writer.  Russian-born American science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov first used the word in 1942 in his short story "Runabout."  Asimov had a much brighter and more optimistic opinion of the robot's role in human society than did Capek.  He generally characterized the robots in his short stories as helpful servants of man and viewed robots as "a better, cleaner race."  Asimov also proposed three "Laws of Robotics" that his robots, as well as sci-fi robotic characters of many other stories, followed:
<br>
         <br>
         <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;"> Law one:</h2>
         <p class="hp">
          A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p>
         <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;"> Law two: </h2>
        <p class="hp"> A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p>
         <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;"> Law three: </h2>
        <p class="hp"> A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. </p>
       </p>
       <hr>
       <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;">Early Conceptions of Robots </h2> <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/901/844/large/charles-e-j-downman-edika-robots-concepts-page-008.jpg?1516008903" width="250px" style="float: right; margin: 20px;">
       <p class="hp"> One of the first instances of a mechanical device built to regularly carry out a particular physical task occurred around 3000 B.C.:  Egyptian water clocks used human figurines to strike the hour bells.  In 400 B.C., Archytus of Taremtum, inventor of the pulley and the screw, also invented a wooden pigeon that could fly.  Hydraulically-operated statues that could speak, gesture, and prophecy were commonly constructed in Hellenic Egypt during the second century B.C. 
        In the first century A.D., Petronius Arbiter made a doll that could move like a human being.  Giovanni Torriani created a wooden robot that could fetch the Emperor's daily bread from the store in 1557.  Robotic inventions reached a relative peak (before the 20th century) in the 1700s; countless ingenius, yet impractical, automata (i.e. robots) were created during this time period.  The 19th century was also filled with new robotic creations, such as a talking doll by Edison and a steam-powered robot by Canadians.  Although these inventions throughout history may have planted the first seeds of inspiration for the modern robot, the scientific progress made in the 20th century in the field of robotics surpass previous advancements a thousandfold.</p>
       <hr>
       <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;"> The first modern robots </h2> <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MAY/sizes/history_robots_resize_md.jpg" width="250px" style="float: left; margin: 20px; padding-left: 80px;">
       <p class="hp"> The earliest robots as we know them were created in the early 1950s by George C. Devol, an inventor from Louisville, Kentucky.  He invented and patented a reprogrammable manipulator called "Unimate," from "Universal Automation."  For the next decade, he attempted to sell his product in the industry, but did not succeed.  In the late 1960s, businessman/engineer Joseph Engleberger acquired Devol's robot patent and was able to modify it into an industrial robot and form a company called Unimation to produce and market the robots.  For his efforts and successes, Engleberger is known in the industry as "the Father of Robotics." 
        Academia also made much progress in the creation new robots.  In 1958 at the Stanford Research Institute, Charles Rosen led a research team in developing a robot called "Shakey."  Shakey was far more advanced than the original Unimate, which was designed for specialized, industrial applications.  Shakey could wheel around the room, observe the scene with his television "eyes," move across unfamiliar surroundings, and to a certain degree, respond to his environment.  He was given his name because of his wobbly and clattering movements. </p>

     <h1> USES </h1>
     <img src="https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/robotics-pillar-page-uses.jpeg" width="700px">
     <article id="robots_uses">
     <h2 style="font-size: 35px;"> Uses of Robots </h2>
     <p class="uses_para" style="border: 1px dashed #B0C4DE; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px;" > Robots have a wide variety of use cases that make them the ideal technology for the future. Soon, we will see robots almost everywhere. We'll see them in our hospitals, in our hotels and even on our roads.</p>
     <br> 
     <h2> Manufacturing </h2>
       <p class="uses_para">The manufacturing industry is probably the oldest and most well-known user of robots. These robots and co-bots (bots that work alongside humans) work to efficiently test and assemble products, like cars and industrial equipment. It’s estimated that there are more than three million industrial robots in use right now.   
     </p>
<br> 
     <h2> Logistics </h2>
     <p class="uses_para">
       Shipping, handling and quality control robots are becoming a must-have for most retailers and logistics companies. Because we now expect our packages to arrive at blazing speeds, logistics companies employ robots in warehouses, and even on the road, to help maximize time efficiency. Right now, there are robots taking your items off the shelves, transporting them across the warehouse floor and packaging them. Additionally, a rise in last-mile robots (robots that will autonomously deliver your package to your door) ensure that you’ll have a face-to-metal-face encounter with a logistics bot in the near future.
     </p>
     <br> 
     <h2> Home </h2>
     <p class="uses_para">It’s not science fiction anymore. Robots can be seen all over our homes, helping with chores, reminding us of our schedules and even entertaining our kids. The most well-known example of home robots is the autonomous vacuum cleaner Roomba. Additionally, robots have now evolved to do everything from autonomously mowing grass to cleaning pools. </p>
<br> 
     <h2> Travel </h2>
     <p class="uses_para">Is there anything more science fiction-like than autonomous vehicles? These self-driving cars are no longer just imagination. A combination of data science and robotics, self-driving vehicles are taking the world by storm. Automakers, like Tesla, Ford, Waymo, Volkswagen and BMW are all working on the next wave of travel that will let us sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. Rideshare companies Uber and Lyft are also developing autonomous rideshare vehicles that don’t require humans to operate the vehicle.</p>
<br> 
     <h2> Healthcare</h2>
     <p class="uses_para"> Robots have made enormous strides in the healthcare industry. These mechanical marvels have use in just about every aspect of healthcare, from robot-assisted surgeries to bots that help humans recover from injury in physical therapy. Examples of robots at work in healthcare are Toyota’s healthcare assistants, which help people regain the ability to walk, and “TUG,” a robot designed to autonomously stroll throughout a hospital and deliver everything from medicines to clean linens.
<br> <br>
Recently, robots have been employed by pharmaceutical companies to help speed up the fight against COVID-19. These bots are now being used to fill and seal COVID-19 testing swabs, and are also being used by some manufacturers to produce PPE and respirators.  </p>

       </ul>
     
     <article id="robo-types">
       <h2 style="font-size: 35px;"> Types of Robots</h2>
       <p class="types_para" style="border: 1px dashed #B0C4DE; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px;"> Mechanical bots come in all shapes and sizes to efficiently carry out the task for which they are designed. All robots vary in design, functionality and degree of autonomy. From the 0.2 millimeter-long “RoboBee” to the 200 meter-long robotic shipping vessel “Vindskip,” robots are emerging to carry out tasks that humans simply can’t. <b style="color: #322F2E;"> Generally, there are five types of robots: </b> </p>
<br> 
       <h2> 1) Pre-Programmed Robots </h2>
       <p class="types_para"> Pre-programmed robots operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks. An example of a pre-programmed robot would be a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line. The arm serves one function — to weld a door on, to insert a certain part into the engine, etc. — and its job is to perform that task longer, faster and more efficiently than a human. </p>
<br> 
       <h2> 2) Humanoid Robots </h2>
       <p class="types_para"> Humanoid robots are robots that look like and/or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia (in the video above) and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas. </p>
<br> 
      
       <h2> 3) Autonomous Robots </h2>
       <p class="types_para"> Autonomous robots operate independently of human operators. These robots are usually designed to carry out tasks in open environments that do not require human supervision. They are quite unique because they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission. An example of an autonomous robot would be the Roomba vacuum cleaner, which uses sensors to roam freely throughout a home. </p>
<br> 
       <h2> 4) Teleoperated Robots </h2>
       <p class="types_para"> Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous bots that use a wireless network to enable human control from a safe distance. These robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather, circumstances, etc. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield. </p>
<br> 
       <h2> 5) Augmenting Robots </h2>
       <p class="types_para"> Augmenting robots either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.</p>
       
<br> <br> <br> 
       <h2> Is robot software considered robotics? </h2>
       <p class="types_para"> A software robot is an abundant type of computer program which carries out tasks autonomously, such as a chatbot or a web crawler. However, because software robots only exist on the internet and originate within a computer, they are not considered robots. In order to be considered a robot, a device must have a physical form, such as a body or a chassis. </p>

       <iframe width="650" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8s5uo2duRkM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
       <h2 style="font-size: 35px;"> How do robots function?</h2>
      <h2>Independent robots </h2>
       <p class="para"> Independent robots are capable of functioning completely autonomously and independent of human operator control. These typically require more intense programming but allow robots to take the place of humans when undertaking dangerous, mundane or otherwise impossible tasks, from bomb diffusion and deep-sea travel to factory automation. Independent robots have proven to be the most disruptive to society, eliminating low-wage jobs but presenting new possibilities for growth.</p>

       <h2> Dependent robots </h2>
       <p class="para">Dependent robots are non-autonomous robots that interact with humans to enhance and supplement their already existing actions. This is a relatively new form of technology and is being constantly expanded into new applications, but one form of dependent robots that has been realized is advanced prosthetics that are controlled by the human mind. 
<br> <br>
A famous example of a dependent robot was created by Johns Hopkins APL in 2018 for a patient named Johnny Matheny, a man whose arm was amputated above the elbow. Matheny was fitted with a Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) so researchers could study its use over a sustained period. The MPL is controlled via electromyography, or signals sent from his amputated limb that controls the prosthesis. Over time, Matheny became more efficient in controlling the MPL and the signals sent from his amputated limb became smaller and less variable, leading to more accuracy in its movements and allowing Matheny to perform tasks as delicate as playing the piano. </p>

       <h1 style="color: #3F3D3C; font-size: 35px;"> Main components of a robot </h1>
       <p class="para" style="border: 1px dashed #B0C4DE; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px;"> Robots are built to present solutions to a variety of needs and fulfill several different purposes, and therefore, require a variety of specialized components to complete these tasks. However, there are several components that are central to every robot’s construction, like a power source or a central processing unit. Generally speaking, robotics components fall into these five categories:</p>
<br>
       <h2>Control system</h2>
       <p class="para"> Computation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing. </p>
<br>
       <h2> Sensors </h2>
       <p class="para"> Sensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.</p>
       <br>
       <h2> Actuators </h2>
       <p class="para"> As previously stated, a device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators,) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles. </p>
<br>
       <h2> Power Supply </h2>
       <p class="para"> Like the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply. 
<br> <br>
Some potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power. </p>
<br> 
       <h2> End Effectors </h2>
       <p class="para"> End effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more. </p>
